  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or coat with baking spray). <br>

<strong>Step 3:</strong>Add in the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract; beat until combined.<br>
    <strong>Step 4:</strong>Add in flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix until just combined, making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl every now and again.<br>
    <strong>Step 5:</strong>Roll dough into 1" balls, and roll in sugar.<br>
    <strong>Step 6:</strong>Place on baking sheet, about 2" apart. Bake for 10-11 minutes, or until cookies have set.<br>
    <strong>Step 7:</strong>Allow to cool and enjoy! <br>

  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 350 degrees. <br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong>Using a food processor, pulse the graham cracker sheets (about 10-12) until they resemble crumbs. <br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong>Next, add in sugar, vanilla extract, and melted butter and pulse the mixture until well combined.<br>
    <strong>Step 4:</strong>Pour graham cracker crumbs into your baking dish and press the crumbs into the bottom of the dish and up along the sides. Set aside.<br>
    <strong>Step 5:</strong>With a hand mixer or a standing mixer, beat cream cheese on a low speed for about 5-10 seconds.<br>
    <strong>Step 6:</strong>While on a low speed, slowly add in the granulated sugar and mix until incorporated, scraping down the sides as needed. Add in vanilla extract and mix until combined.<br>
    <strong>Step 7:</strong>Next, add in the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and mix on low until everything is combined and the filling is silky and smooth.<br>
    <strong>Step 8:</strong>Pour cheesecake batter over the graham cracker crust and spread in an even layer. <br>
    <strong>Step 9:</strong> Bake for 22-25 minutes (mine is usually done at approximately 24 minutes), or until the center of the cheesecake jiggles slightly when the baking dish is gently moved. <br>
    <strong>Step 10:</strong> Turn the oven off, crack the door, and let the cheesecake slowly cool for about 45-60 minutes (I ususally do 60 minutes, but if youâ€™re pressed for time, you can pull it out at 45 minutes). <br>
    <strong>Step 11:</strong> Continue to cool the cheesecake on the counter until it reaches room temperature. <br>
    <strong>Step 12:</strong> Finally, chill the cheesecake in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or overnight if possible (cheesecake gets better the colder it gets). <br>
    <strong>Step 13:</strong> In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, cook apples, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract until the apples are at your desired tenderness. For me, the apples are perfect after cooking for about 3-4 minutes (soft with still a bit of a bite to them). <br>
    <strong>Step 14:</strong>Allow the topping to come to room temperature before topping on the cheesecake. <br>
    <strong>Step 15:</strong> Top the cheesecake with the apple topping. <br>
    <strong>Step 16:</strong> At this point you can serve the cheesecake, or you can chill it again if you prefer the topping to be cold. <br>
    <strong>Step 17:</strong> Drizzle the cheesecake with caramel sauce. <br>
    <strong>Step 18:</strong> Refrigerate leftovers. <br>
